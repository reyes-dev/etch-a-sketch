# etch-a-sketch
I will be creating a web page that has a 16x16 grid of square divs.
I will be using CSS Grid and JavaScript.
The program should have a hover effect when the cursor goes over a div.
The program should have a button that asks for user input to decide the number of squares on each side of the grid.
This new grid should be empty and fit in the same total space, (e.g. 960px wide) just with more boxes.
The input should have a limit of 100.
